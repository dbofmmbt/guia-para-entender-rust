# Rust Handbook :rocket

The objective of this book is to offer guidance on the study of the language: to explain well what is important for everyone to know and offer high-quality references for the learning of more specific or advanced topics.

Beware that this project is a work in progress. The most recent version of the handbook can be found here: <https://dbofmmbt.github.io/rust-handbook/>

Suggestions and feedback are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue or get in touch through Rust Community's Discord.
