# Rust Handbook

<!-- TODO insert image -->

Rust is a very well-thought programming language. It seeks to unite a variety of existing concepts from other languages, industry and academia in order to be a solid language to develop reliable and efficient solutions in a productive manner.

On the other hand, it gained the fame of being a language with a steep learning curve. I'm not going to fool you: Rust has a lot of resources to help you, but first you need to understand how they work. What I can tell you is that, in general, every choice made in this language has a purpose. Once you get the reasons, something which seemed complicated may become understandable.

If you intend to develop an application with a high degree of concurrent processing to serve a lot of HTTP requests, you'll probably need to learn about async programming (`async/await`). In case you deal directly with hardware on embedded programming, maybe you'll need to use `unsafe` to interact with the native resource of the target device. While developing a library, it may look interest to implement macros to create a more convenient interface for your users.

Know that you don't need to learn all of this at once, nor be a specialist on all of the language's resources. Each person can focus on those which are relevant for the fool they want to develop. Do not think that you need to absorb everything at the same time, because nobody should.

What I propose here is the understanding of the language. There are core concepts which every developer must know to be productive, no matter what kind of the application they do. Those are the ones I aim to teach in this material.

Besides that, I'll present these concepts in a specific order. Each topic is carefully designed to be based on the previous ones, forming learning layers. You shouldn't try to build the second floor of a building without building the first one, right?

Any concept or detail that I consider out of the scope of this handbook will have references for high-quality content available elsewhere, in order to complement this guide.
