# Pre-requisites

In general, I assume that the reader knows how to program, at least in a basic level. If I were to write a guide to teach someone to program from scratch (and I intend to do it someday!) I would explain them about computer fundamentals and programming paradigms, and that would take a while to write well. If you don't know how to program and wants to follow the guide anyway, remember to take it easy and search for additional information on the web when you feel the need.

Another important requisite is the alignment with my proposal. My focus is on the understanding of the concepts. In software, to understand what you're doing could be the difference between solving a problem in minutes or in days. There'll be examples and exercises throughout the guide, but my focus is always conceptual.
