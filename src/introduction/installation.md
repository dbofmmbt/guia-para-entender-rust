# Installation

The most recommended way to install Rust is by using `rustup`, which takes care of the installations and updates of the language's official tools, such as `rustc`, `cargo`, and `clippy`.

If you decided to install the language on your machine, just follow the instructions in the [rustup's website](https://rustup.rs) and you'll probably be good to go. In case you use Windows, I recommend you to take a look at the [Setup Rust for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup) page, as you may need to install additional dependencies.

In case you want to do small experiments without having to install the language, a good alternative is to use [the playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/), which is an online editor that allows you to compile and run simple code. It's also a good way to share code snippets with other people in case you need help on specific questions.
